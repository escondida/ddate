Seeker: Who would actually attempt to enter a year with 15 digits?

Programmer: A Discordian.

Seeker: Why not allow more digits, then?

Programmer: Once, when I was a novice, I asked my master who would
actually attempt to enter a year with 15 digits.

(The programmer fell silent and sat staring into the fire.)

Seeker: (Eventually) What did your master say?

Programmer: "A Discordian."

Seeker: What happened then?

Programmer: I asked her "Why not allow more digits, then?"

Seeker: What did she say?

Programmer: She cursed and spat in my face and called me a fool. Then
she told me a story.

Seeker: What story?

Programmer: She said, "Once, when I was a novice, I asked my master
who would actually attempt to enter a year with 15 digits."

(The programmer stood and brushed dirt, leaves, and twigs from her
trousers, then rode off into the woods on a bear).
